                                        important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout
                                        the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                    <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then 
                                        touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                    <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from 
                                        food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                                             and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries,

                                            them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take 
                                            steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider 
                                            to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency

                                    <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal 
                                        congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people 
                                        become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the 
                                        disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously 
                                        ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood 
                                        pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and 
                                        difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                    <p>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body

                                    <p>No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide

                                    <p>The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against
